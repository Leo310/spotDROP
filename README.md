Our goal is to develop an interactive website that is based on a
hypothetical community based and this should use. The point is sharing
from places in Berlin that are not necessarily addressed. This can

be (just to give a primitive example). Optional one should take the path
be able to describe for example by a suitable marking The
Users should rate, comment, upload and share the locations
can.
